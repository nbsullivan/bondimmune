def my_bond_generator(max_months, month_duration, face_value, coupon_rate, ncp):
    
    """
    my_bond_generator is a function that will create a row vector
    of payments based on the following arguments:
    
        max_months - the maximum number of months in the entire portfolio
                     (i.e., our planning horizon).
        month_duration - the number of months for which the created bond will 
                         make payments.
        face_value - the face or par value of the bond.
        coupon_rate - the percentage of the face value that will be used
                      as the coupon payment amount (5% = 0.05).
        ncp      -    the Number of Coupon Payments in a year (used to pad 0's)
                      and must be a factor of 12.
    
    The created vector will be a list of MONTHLY payments (if no payment at
    a particular month, then the value will be 0 in that element) and the size
    of the vector will be equal to max_months.  Thus, the first element of 
    the created vector will be the payment at month 1.
    
    EXAMPLE: To create a 6-month bond with bi-monthly coupon payments at 5%,
             and a par value of $100, we would call
             
             B = my_bond_generator(max_months, 6, 100, 0.05, 6),
             
             where max_months would depend on our portfolio makeup.
             
    """
    
    B = np.zeros(max_months)
    cp = face_value*coupon_rate
    
    if (12%ncp != 0):
        raise RuntimeError('number of coupons in a year must be a factor of 12')

    step_size = 12/ncp
    B[step_size - 1:month_duration - 1:step_size] = cp
    B[month_duration - 1] = (1+coupon_rate)*face_value
    
    return B

def my_Price_Change(B, i, ncp):
    
    """
    my_Price_Change will compute the expected change in price per UNIT change
    in the interest rate using the following arguments:
    
        B - a row vector of bond payments (from my_bond_generator)
        i - the interest rate at which the bond was purchased
        ncp - the number of coupon payments in a year for bond B
    
    The output will be a single number.  To convert the ouput to actual changes
    in interest rate, you must multiply the output by the percentage change
    in the rate to a unit.
    
    EXAMPLE: P = my_Price_Change(B,0.1,12) will give the price change for a
             bond, B, created through the function my_bond_generator that pays
             monthly coupons.  Suppose the interest rate changes from 10% to 
             10.1%.  We would multiply Price_Change by (10.1-10)/1 = 0.1 to 
             find the actual change in bond price.
